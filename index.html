        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jacob Olsen, and Iâ€™m excited to share this simple website with you. I enjoy learning about web development, progaming, I.T. and other CS topics. In my free time, I love playing Dungens & Dragons with my freinds, reading, and spending time outdoors.</p>
        <p>This website is a small step toward showcasing my skills and experiments with coding. Stay tuned for more updates and improvements!</p>
